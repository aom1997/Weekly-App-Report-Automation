This project is designed to automate the weekly reporting process for the Super-Doctor app. Super-Doctor is an internal application that helps in-network primary care providers manage their patients more effectively. It enables providers to receive patient admission and discharge alerts from the healthcare information exchange center and take timely actions, such as scheduling post-discharge visits, sharing electronic medical records with hospitals, and directly contacting patients to provide cost-saving and time-efficient advice. These actions significantly reduce medical costs while improving care quality. The app reports evaluate the performance of primary care providers and their corresponding PC consultants in processing alerts. Key metrics include the percentage of alerts processed or read within three business days. Higher performance correlates with greater cost savings, making these reports a crucial resource for stakeholders. They provide insights into provider performance and support efforts to educate or remind providers to promptly address patient alerts.
